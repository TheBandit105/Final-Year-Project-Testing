# Individual Project

This is my individual project for vision-based emotion detection.

## Patch Notes

3 October 2021 - As of currently, the application has not been made yet.

15 October 2021 - Have started working on creating the application for the emotion recognition software for the final year project.

22 October 2021 - Have got a basic menu setup completed where the user can select one of 3 options in the software, which are to run the ERS itself, view the credits of the application and quit the application entirely. Upon clicking the run button for the ERS, the user will be taken to another window, which is currently blank at the moment. The user can now quit the entire application from this window as well.

12 November 2021 - Looked into getting the face detection working first. This was done by getting OpenCV to activate the webcam that was built into my computer. Afterwards, using haarcascade as a reference point for the faces, the rectangle is drawn on the webcam application when a face is detected in range of the camera. It currently works well, but has a bit of a difficult time detecting faces that have obstructions in the way, such as glasses.
